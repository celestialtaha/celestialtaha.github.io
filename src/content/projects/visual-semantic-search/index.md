![Visual Semantic Search](/images/projects/visual-search.jpg)

This project implements a visual semantic search system that allows users to search for products using natural language queries. The system retrieves visually relevant images based on text descriptions, bridging the gap between language and visual content.

## How It Works

The system leverages OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model to create a unified embedding space for both images and text. This enables powerful cross-modal search capabilities:

1. **Image Embedding**: Product images are processed through CLIP's vision encoder to create visual embeddings
2. **Query Embedding**: User text queries are processed through CLIP's text encoder
3. **Similarity Matching**: The system finds images whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding
4. **Ranked Results**: Results are presented in order of semantic similarity to the query

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image Search**: Find relevant product images using natural language descriptions
- **Semantic Understanding**: The system understands concepts beyond simple keywords
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for search and exploration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large product catalogs efficiently
- **Pre-computed Embeddings**: Fast search through vectorized product database

## Technologies

- Python
