PyPoint is a lightweight Python library designed for efficiently labeling specific points in images using mouse input. It provides a simple yet powerful interface for image annotation tasks, particularly useful for computer vision projects, data collection, and machine learning applications that require precise point labeling.

## Key Features

- **Simple Point Labeling**: Easily mark and record specific points in images using mouse clicks
- **Image Navigation**: View and navigate through multiple images in a dataset
- **Customizable Interface**: Adjust visualization parameters to suit different annotation needs
- **Export Functionality**: Save labeled points in standard formats for further processing
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images in sequence
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight implementation with few external dependencies
- **Cross-platform**: Works across different operating systems

## Technical Implementation

The library is built with:
- **Python**: Core language for the library
- **OpenCV**: For image loading, display, and manipulation
- **NumPy**: For efficient data handling and storage of coordinates


## Use Cases

- **Computer Vision Datasets**: Create labeled datasets for training machine learning models
- **Medical Imaging**: Mark specific anatomical points or regions of interest
- **Facial Recognition**: Label facial landmarks for recognition algorithms
- **Motion Tracking**: Create reference points for tracking algorithms
- **Research Applications**: Precisely annotate scientific images for analysis

PyPoint addresses the need for a streamlined, focused tool for point-based image annotation, eliminating the complexity of larger annotation suites while providing the essential functionality needed for point labeling tasks.
