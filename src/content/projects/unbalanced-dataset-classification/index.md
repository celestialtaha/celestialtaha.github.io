![Unbalanced Dataset Classification](/images/projects/imbalanced-data.jpg)

This project addresses one of the most common and challenging problems in machine learning: classification with highly imbalanced datasets. When classes are unevenly distributed, standard machine learning algorithms tend to favor the majority class, resulting in poor performance for minority classes.

## Boosting Techniques Implemented

This repository focuses on boosting techniques specifically designed for imbalanced datasets:

- **AdaBoost M2**: An extension of AdaBoost for multiclass classification problems
- **SMOTE Boost**: Combines Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with boosting
- **RusBoost**: Integrates random undersampling with boosting algorithms

## Key Features

- Implementation of multiple boosting techniques for imbalanced data
- Comparative analysis of different approaches
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification
- Practical examples with real-world datasets

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning

## Applications

The techniques demonstrated in this project are applicable to numerous real-world scenarios:
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis of rare conditions
- Anomaly detection
- Predictive maintenance
- Customer churn prediction

This project provides practical solutions for practitioners dealing with class imbalance problems in their machine learning workflows.
