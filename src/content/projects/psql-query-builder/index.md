This AI-powered PostgreSQL Query Builder allows users to generate and run SQL queries by simply providing natural language instructions. It bridges the gap between non-technical users and database operations by leveraging AI to translate plain English into optimized PostgreSQL queries.

## Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered SQL Generation**: Convert natural language to optimized PostgreSQL queries
- **⚡ Smart Schema Caching**: Automatically analyzes and caches database schema for context-aware queries
- **🛠️ Flexible Configuration**: Customize behavior for different database environments
- **🔧 Intelligent Error Handling**: Provides helpful feedback when queries can't be generated or executed
- **📊 LangChain Compatible**: Easily integrate with LangChain workflows
- **💬 Interactive Mode**: Engage in conversational query building

## Use Cases

- **📊 Data Analysts**: Generate complex queries without deep SQL knowledge
- **👨‍💻 Developers**: Quickly prototype database operations
- **🛡️ Database Admins**: Simplify common database tasks

## Technical Implementation

The tool is built with:
- **Python**: Core language for the library
- **LangChain**: For AI integration and prompt engineering
- **Large Language Models**: Powers the natural language understanding
- **psycopg2**: For PostgreSQL connection and query execution
- **Schema Analysis**: Automatic database introspection for context-aware queries

## Example Usage

```python
from psql_query_builder import PostgreSQLQueryBuilder

# Initialize the query builder with your database connection
query_builder = PostgreSQLQueryBuilder(connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb")

# Generate and execute a query from natural language
results = query_builder.query("Find all users who signed up in the last month and have made at least 3 purchases")

# View the generated SQL
print(query_builder.last_sql)

# Process the results
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

This project makes database interaction more accessible by allowing users to query PostgreSQL databases using natural language, eliminating the need to write complex SQL by hand.
