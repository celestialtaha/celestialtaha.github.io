During my experience, I led a team of two ML/AI engineers in developing a deep learning-based algorithm for monitoring vital signs, including heart rate, SpO2, and respiratory rate. We went through the entire process, from data collection and AI model design to training, validation, extensive real-world testing, and finally, deployment on mobile devices.
